Homework 5 
Object Oriented Programming and File IO  
The following problem set is worth 100 points.  Please submit a zip file containing all source code I need 
to run your assignments using QtSPIM.  Code will be graded on elegance and correctness. 
Problem 1: Set Program (40pts) 
Create a class IntegerSet which can hold integers in the range from 0 to 100.  The set is represented 
internally as an array of ones and zeroes.  Array element a[i] is 1 if the integer i is in the set.  Array 
element a[i] is 0 if the integer i is not in the set.  The default constructor initializes the set to be the 
“empty set”, a set whose array representation consists of all zeroes. 
Include the following member set functions on your class: 
Method Name Method Description 
unionOf A method that creates a third set which is the 
union of two set objects (e.g. an element in the 
third set’s array is 1 if it is 1 in either of the arrays 
of the two sets).  
intersectionOf A method that creates a third set which is the 
intersection of two set objects (e.g. an element in 
the third set’s array is 1 if it is 1 in the array of 
each set argument). 
insertElement Inserts a new integer k into a set 
deleteElement Removes an integer k from a set 
printSet A method that prints a set with each element 
separated by spaces 
equals Used to compare two set objects for equality 
In your main method create a number of sets and test each of the methods above.  Save your code in 
set.asm. 
Problem 2: Account Problem (30pts) 
Create a class named SavingsAccount.  This class contains instance data such as the following: 
Data Member Description 
annualInterestRate Interest rate set for the account 
savingsBalance The amount the account currently has on deposit 
accountNumber Unique identifying number for the account 
(integer) 
Include the methods on your class 
Method Name Description 
calculateMonthlyInterest Multiplies the balance by the interest rate and 
divides by 12 (this is then added to the balance) 
setInterestRate Changes the value of the annual interest rate 
printBalance Prints the balance on the account 
In your main method, create two account objects, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00 respectively.  
Set the annual interest rate to 3% on each account.  Then calculate the monthly interest rate and print 
the new balances for each account.  Then set the interest rate to 4% on each account.  Print the new 
monthly balances on each account.   
Save your code in savingsAccount.asm. 
Problem 3: File Problem (30pts) 
Using the account code you created above, consider two text files: balances.txt and transactions.txt.  
The balance text file looks like the following: 
100 
348.17 
300 
27.19 
500 
0.00 
700 
1000.00 
The transaction text file looks like the following: 
100 
27.14 
300 
62.11 
400 
100.56 
900 
82.17 
In a real-world environment, this file would be some delimited file (separated by commas, pipes, tabs, 
etc.)  Since parsing a line is difficult to do with MIPS, the next best option is to read a text file line by line.  
A record in either file is represented as a pair.  The first line in the pair is the account number and the 
second line in the file is some amount.  In the balance file, the amount would be the initial value of the 
account.  In the transaction file the amount would be the amount that is being deposited in the account. 
For instance, if you see these two lines in the transaction file: 
200 
34.17 
300 
-14.40 
Account 200 has $34.17 deposited in their account.  Account 300 has $14.40 withdrawn from their 
account. 
In your main method, use these two files in your main method as follows: 
1. Create accounts for each record in balanaces.txt with initial values given 
2. Set each annual interest rate to each account as 3% 
3. Read each record in transactions.txt and debit or credit the account accordingly 
4. Invoke the monthly interest method on each account 
5. Print the balance of each account after the interest is applied 
Save your solution in a file named savingsAccountFile.asm.
